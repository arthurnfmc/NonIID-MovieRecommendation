# Non-IID Movie Recommendation

This repository contains the code and resources related to the project developed for the **Recommendation Systems (BCC409)** course at **Universidade Federal de Ouro Preto (UFOP)**. The project aims to explore **Federated Learning** in scenarios with **non-IID data** (non-Independent and Identically Distributed) for the task of movie recommendation.

## Description

The project focuses on applying **Federated Learning** techniques in Recommendation Systems (RS), especially in scenarios where data is distributed in a non-IID manner. The main motivation is to evaluate how non-IID data distribution affects the performance of recommendation models and to explore strategies to mitigate these effects, such as partial data sharing among network nodes.

### Objectives

1. **Evaluate the impact of non-IID data** on the performance of recommendation models.
2. **Implement and test the data sharing strategy** proposed by Zhao et al [^1] to mitigate the negative effects of non-IID data.

3. **Compare the performance** of models trained in IID and non-IID scenarios.

## Technologies

The project was developed using the Python (3.11.0) programming language and the following libraries:

- pandas==2.2.3
- numpy==2.2.2
- scikit-learn==1.6.1
- tensorflow==2.18.0
- datasets==3.1.0
- flwr==1.15.1
- flwr-datasets==0.5.0

This experiment was conducted with an AMD Ryzen Threadripper 3960X (24 cores 48 threads) running at 3.70GHz and 128GB DDR4 RAM.
